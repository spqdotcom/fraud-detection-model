# Data Directory

This directory contains information about the dataset used for the final project of the bootcamp, focused on fraud detection. The dataset is not included here directly to comply with the terms of use from its original source. Instead, you can download it from the official Kaggle competition page.

## Dataset Source
The dataset used in this project is from the **IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection Competition** hosted on Kaggle in 2019. It contains anonymized transaction data for fraud detection research, provided by the IEEE Computational Intelligence Society (CIS). You can access and download the dataset from the following link:

- [IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection Competition on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/ieee-fraud-detection/overview)

Please note that to download the dataset, you must:
- Have a Kaggle account.
- Accept the competition rules and terms, which include restrictions on usage (e.g., for non-commercial purposes only, such as education and research).
- Be aware that the dataset is subject to specific licensing requirements outlined in the competition rules.

## Usage Instructions
1. Visit the Kaggle competition link provided above.
2. Log in to your Kaggle account (or create one if you donâ€™t have it).
3. Navigate to the "Data" tab on the competition page and download the dataset files (e.g., `train_transaction.csv`, `train_identity.csv`, etc.).
4. Ensure you comply with the competition's usage policies, particularly regarding non-commercial use and restrictions on data redistribution.

## Notes
- The dataset contains real, anonymized transaction data provided by the IEEE-CIS, intended for fraud detection research.
- This project uses the dataset to develop a fraud detection model, with the presentation stored in `results`.
- Be mindful of the competition rules, especially if you intend to share code or models publicly (e.g., code derived from this dataset should be shared under an open-source license as per the competition guidelines).
- For any questions about the dataset or its usage, refer to the Kaggle competition page or contact the competition organizers.

Thank you for respecting the data source guidelines!
